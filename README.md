RPG Items

There are 63 items in the mod featuring 30 different effects.\
It is multiplayer compatible but the items are force-wide. (That's the only way of doing it bug-free)\
The market can be built (pretty expensive) but you get a free market on new games.\
In the beginning you can choose your talents, changing them costs some gold.\
You can set a price-multiplier, by default the prices are balanced for a >50 hours game.\
I suggest installing some difficulty mods, for example natural evolution enemies, but there are also some items that aren't combat related.\
You get 1 gold per kill and 1 gold per second.\
Please install https://mods.factorio.com/mod/m-spell-pack for the complete experience.
